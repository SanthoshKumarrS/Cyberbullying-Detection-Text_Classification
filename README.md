# Cyberbullying-Detection-Text_Classification
In this repository, I worked on the Cyberbullying-Detection-Text_Classification problem to classify the tweet as POSITIVE/NEGATIVE

# Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a text classification problem focused on identifying cyberbullying in tweets. The goal is to classify tweets into two categories: POSITIVE and NEGATIVE, with "NEGATIVE" indicating that the tweet contains some form of cyberbullying, including hate speech, aggression, insults, and toxicity.

# ðŸ§­ Problem Statement:
You are provided with twitter_parsed_tweets: You have to perform a step-by-step NLP approach to identify the toxicity of the tweet and classify the tweet in a binary value.

# Model :
A sequential neural network model has been trained for this text classification task. The model architecture consists of two layers, including an embedding layer and a dense layer. The model has been trained on the provided dataset, achieving an accuracy of 95% on the test data.

# Project Structure :
The project structure is organized as follows:

* [data/](https://github.com/SanthoshKumarrS/Cyberbullying-Detection-Text_Classification/tree/main/Dataset): Contains the dataset files.
* [model/](https://github.com/SanthoshKumarrS/Cyberbullying-Detection-Text_Classification/tree/main/Model): Contains the trained model weights and architecture.
* [notebook/](https://github.com/SanthoshKumarrS/Cyberbullying-Detection-Text_Classification/tree/main/Notebook): Contains the source code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
